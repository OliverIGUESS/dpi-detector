## 📋 What is dpi-detector?

dpi-detector is a tool designed to help you find out if your internet connection is being blocked or interfered with. It checks common ways that internet service providers or governments might try to stop you from accessing information. 

The tool looks for issues with:
- TLS (secure website connections)
- TCP (basic internet data transfers)
- HTTP (web pages)
- DNS (how website names are found)
- Connection drops within 16-20KB data flow

If you're curious whether your internet access is being restricted or slowed down, dpi-detector can tell you.

  - macOS 10.13 or newer
  - Linux (most recent versions like Ubuntu 18.04+, Fedora 30+, Debian 10+)
- At least 100 MB free disk space
